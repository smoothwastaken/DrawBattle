# DrawBattle
## **Introduction**
  DrawBattle is a NSI Project where we have to make something with the python module:

> [`turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle "turtle: An educational framework for simple graphics applications")  â€” Turtle graphics

Here's the development branch got update each time I work on.
I hope that you will get fun to see how far we gone! 
 
 Have a nice day :)

## Installation
Clone this repository to somewhere in your computer and `cd` in:

    git clone https://github.com/smoothwastaken/DrawBattle.git
    cd ./DrawBattle

To install all the stuff for DrawBattle works, you can just launch the `setup.sh` file (with sudo permissions):

    sudo bash ./setup.sh

## How to use
The use if very simple.
To start playing, you have to launch the server on an available port (see it as a room number) with the following command:
### Linux

    sudo python3 test7-server.py -p <port>
 Be sure that the players are on the same network than you. 
After it you can just start playing as a player with the following command:
### Linux

    sudo python3 test7-client.py

See the "Issues" section to know why MacOs isn't supported.


## Issues

### Windows
There are some small issues on Windows so we can't play on for the moment...

### MacOS players
For the players movements, we used keyboard module:

    import keyboard

But the issue is that with macOs, this python module crash all the things because of this function:

    keyboard.is_pressed("key")
So I needed to test on others computers. And as you can understand, if you want to play on a computer with MacOs on you can't because of this module. If there is any fix I'll update the repository.
